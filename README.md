# Cryptocurrencies mining simulation

## Introduction
This project simulates the mining process of proof of work cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin with different mining strategies.

Team with Tianyu Huang https://github.com/TianyuHuang-000

## Mining Strategies
1. Majority Mining

Perform Majority Mining when you have >50% of total hash power

2. Selfish Mining

Miners hide their generated blocks from the main blockchain to maximise their earning

3. Fee Sniping Mining

Deliberately re-mines one or more previous blocks in order to take the fees from the miners who originally created those blocks.

## How to run
Simply run the tests and see whether the strategies pass the tests.
