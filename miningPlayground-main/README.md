Class assignment to study Bitcoin mining strategies in a simple simulator.

Students should modify the classes MajorityMiner, SelfishMiner and FeeSnipingMiner, overriding methods as necessary to implement the desired functionality.

This assignment was originally developed by Joseph Bonneau and Benedikt BÃ¼nz at Stanford, with later development by Joseph Bonneau, Assimakis Kattis and Kevin Choi at NYU.
